## MongoDB

- Collection - an organized store of documents in MongoDB usually with common fields between documents. There can be many collections per database and many documents per collection.

- Document - a way to organize and store data as a set of field-value pairs.

- Field - a unique identifier for a datapoint.

- Value - data related to a given identifier.

- Collection - an organized store of documents in MongoDB, usually with common fields between documents. There can be many collections per database and many documents per collection.

## MongoDB Atlas

- Replica Set - a few connected machines that store the same data to ensure that if something happens to one of the machines the data will remain intact. Comes from the word replicate - to copy something.

- Instance - a single machine locally or in the cloud, running a certain software, in our case it is the MongoDB database.

- Cluster - group of servers that store your data.

## What is JSON?

JavaScript Object Notation, more commonly known as JSON, was defined as part of the JavaScript language in the early 2000s by JavaScript creator Douglas Crockford, though it wasn’t until 2013 that the format was officially specified.

JavaScript objects are simple associative containers, wherein a string key is mapped to a value (which can be a number, string, function, or even another object). This simple language trait allowed JavaScript objects to be represented remarkably simply in text:

```
{
  "_id": 1,
  "name" : { "first" : "John", "last" : "Backus" },
  "contribs" : [ "Fortran", "ALGOL", "Backus-Naur Form", "FP" ],
  "awards" : [
    {
      "award" : "W.W. McDowell Award",
      "year" : 1967,
      "by" : "IEEE Computer Society"
    }, {
      "award" : "Draper Prize",
      "year" : 1993,
      "by" : "National Academy of Engineering"
    }
  ]
}

```

## What is BSON?

BSON simply stands for “Binary JSON,” and that’s exactly what it was invented to be. BSON’s binary structure encodes type and length information, which allows it to be parsed much more quickly.

Since its initial formulation, BSON has been extended to add some optional non-JSON-native data types, like dates and binary data, without which MongoDB would have been missing some valuable support.

Languages that support any kind of complex mathematics typically have different sized integers (ints vs longs) or various levels of decimal precision (float, double, decimal128, etc.).

Not only is it helpful to be able to represent those distinctions in data stored in MongoDB, it also allows for comparisons and calculations to happen directly on data in ways that simplify consuming application code.

```
{"hello": "world"} →
\x16\x00\x00\x00           // total document size
\x02                       // 0x02 = type String
hello\x00                  // field name
\x06\x00\x00\x00world\x00  // field value
\x00                       // 0x00 = type EOO ('end of object')

{"BSON": ["awesome", 5.05, 1986]} →
 \x31\x00\x00\x00
 \x04BSON\x00
 \x26\x00\x00\x00
 \x02\x30\x00\x08\x00\x00\x00awesome\x00
 \x01\x31\x00\x33\x33\x33\x33\x33\x33\x14\x40
 \x10\x32\x00\xc2\x07\x00\x00
 \x00
 \x00

```
